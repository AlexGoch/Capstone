I want to build an application that allows users to track their small, often frivolous purchases each month. This app is not a complete budgeting app, and users will not be tracking static monthly expenses such as bills, rent, insurance, etc. The purpose of the app is to help people visualize where a large portion of their money is going each month. The types of purchases users will track are referred to as “Cuts” as in “Death by a thousand cuts” because I know from experience that even spending an extra $5-10 a day adds up over the course of a month. Sample “Cuts” purchases include energy drinks, snacks, coffee, online sales, etc. The app will have a simple UX flow of Login -> My Spending (Input Data) -> View my Monthly Spending (Visualized Data in a Pie Chart) -> Save $$ (Coupon API).
